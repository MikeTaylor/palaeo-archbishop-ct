Come to think of it, I have no idea why I'm sending you this instead of
withholding it until you reply to the rhea thread. Guess I'm just a
soft-hearted fool.

Anyway, using the attached image I got 12,258 gray pixels / (12,258 + 36809
white) = 0.2498. So it seems that your eyeball ASP-o-meter is a lot better
than mine, since you said 20-30% and I said 17%. Still pretty darned low for
a neosauropod!

Best,

Matt

"To put yourself forward as someone good enough to do interesting things is,
by definition, to expose yourself to all kinds of negative judgments, and as
far as I can tell, the fact that other people get to decide what they think
of your behavior leaves only two strategies for not suffering from those
judgments: not doing anything, or not caring about the reaction."
--Clay Shirky
